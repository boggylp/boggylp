## Some thoughts üß†

Everybody develops their own opinions, so I am no exception to the rule:

- "It depends", on what? Developer communication should be as clear as possible
- Code styling should be standardized, in service to readability, use formatters
- Start simple, grow in complexity when needed
  - i.e. do not use Automapper in your projects on first sign of transforming from DTO to domain model
  - i.e. do not introduce DDD in a microservice which is basically a simple CRUD
- Try to automate your repeatable simple work
- Learn you keyboard shortcuts in your editor of choice (or vim)
- Terminal is your friend, shoutout to all open source devs working on amazing terminal tools like [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf), [zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide)...
- Big fan of keeping your documentation close to source code instead of separate apps like confluence
- Software is getting worse in quality, we are riding the wave of technological advancement in hardware üå∂Ô∏è
- Tech debt is called debt for a good reason

General inspirations:

- The amount of context a human can grasp is greater than the amount of context a human [communicate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSRHeXYDLko)
- Assume positive intent, with [cooperation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mScpHTIi-kM) we win in the long run
